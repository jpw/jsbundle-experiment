# jsbundle-experiment

A little demo of bundling JS from a variety of sources for consumption by ES5 &amp; ES6 clients. Based on my [rollup & bundling demo](https://github.com/jpw/testing-rollup).

## Aims

1. We want to include 3rd party JS for the browser from npm.
1. We want to include many granular FE packages of CSS, JS, templates & images from our main package repo.


## to use TODO check me

Clone this repo, then: `npm i`

Build the assets: `npm run build-js`

Run the express server: `node app`
